## Release Details

### Podman v4.5.1

Podman Desktop 1.1 moves up to [Podman 4.5.1](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v4.5.1).

### Extensions

Optional extensions will follow their own lifecycle and update independently from Podman Desktop. As of
this release you'll be able to see when there is an update available and install from within
Podman Desktop [#2655](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2655).

We've also added options in **<Icon icon="fa-solid fa-cog" size="lg" />Settings > Preferences** to
automatically check for and install extension updates.

engine type Lima runs on and override the instance name [#2674](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2674).
