## Release Details

### Update to Podman v4.4.1 [#1456](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1456)

Podman Desktop 0.12 embeds [Podman 4.4.1](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v4.4.1) in Windows and macOS installers. Make sure to upgrade to benefit from the latest Podman features and bug fixes.

### Configuring port mappings when an image has no exported port [#1265](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1265)

With the latest update, users can now add multiple local-to-remote port mappings when starting a container from an image that has no exported ports. This feature provides users with the flexibility to specify which ports on their local machine should map to which ports on the container, even if the container does not have any exported ports by default.

### Installing Podman Desktop on Windows Home Edition [#1268](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1268)

Podman Desktop 0.12 offers the ability to be installed on Windows Home Edition. The mechanism uses Virtual Machine Platform detection, instead of hyper-v. WSL2 is still requires but can be installed along with the installation process.

### Option to automatically minimize Podman Desktop on login [#1374](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1374)

Podman Desktop now provides a "start minimized" option when users log in onto the laptop. This option, available from the application's settings, can be useful if users want to automatically launch Podman Desktop at log in, but prefer not to have the window visible on the screen. With this feature, you can ensure that Podman Desktop is up and running in the background without any interruption to your workflows.

- Go to **<Icon icon="fa-solid fa-cog" size="lg" /> Settings > Preferences > Login: Minimize** to activate the option.

### UI and UX Improvements

#### Improved actions consistency [#1225](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1225)

Actions displayed in the list pages for Images and Containers have been reviewed and made consistent between other pages.

Actions displayed in the header of the container's details page have been improved so that the actions are always displayed in the same order.

The status icons for Pods, Containers, Images, and Volumes have been unified and use consistent states.

Icons in empty screens have been updated to use the same consistent SVG icon as the status icons.
