We’re honored to announce that [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/) has been recognized with the prestigious [**2024 DEVIES Award**](https://www.developerweek.com/awards/) in the category of **Containers & Kubernetes**. This award is a testimony to the effectiveness of the Podman Desktop team and greater open-source community's efforts to help developers. Podman Desktop increases developer container workflow efficiency as well as provides [an easy transition of applications from containers to Kubernetes](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2023/11/06/working-kubernetes-podman-desktop), the leading open-source container orchestration platform.

We are extremely proud to receive this outstanding recognition which celebrates passion, commitment and innovation for shaping the future of container development backed by the vibrant open-source standards that Red Hat supports. ” said [Stévan Le Meur](https://twitter.com/stevanlm), _Product Manager_ on the Podman Desktop team.
