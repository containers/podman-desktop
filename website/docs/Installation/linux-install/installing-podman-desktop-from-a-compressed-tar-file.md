# Installing Podman Desktop from a compressed tar file {#archive}

Consider installing from an archive rather than [from Flathub](../linux-install), or [from a Flatpak bundle](installing-podman-desktop-from-a-flatpak-bundle) when:

- You cannot use Flatpak.
- You install in a restricted environment.

#### Prerequisites

- [Podman](https://podman.io/) stable version

#### Procedure

1. Download the
   `podman-desktop-<version>.tar.gz` archive from the [Git repository release assets](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/releases).
2. Extract the content.
3. Go to the extracted directory.
4. Double-click on the `podman-desktop` executable file.
